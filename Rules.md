STRICTLY NEVER create, update,close issues without my instructions.

when updating an issue - 
 1.	Retrieve the issue body
 2.	Update the checklist in the issue body
 3.	Add a progress comment

KISS - KEEP IT SIMPLE STABLE.

### Follow the SOLID Principles

1. Single Responsibility: Each class should have only one reason to change.
2. Open-Closed: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. Liskov Substitution: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
4. Interface Segregation: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
5. Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.

To ensure you properly follow technical documentation in the future, I'll implement these specific practices:

	1	Document-First Approach: Before writing any code, I'll thoroughly read and analyze all relevant technical documentation, creating a clear mental model of requirements.
	2	Direct Reference: When implementing features, I'll keep the technical documentation open and directly reference it rather than relying on memory.
	3	Requirement Traceability: For each implementation, I'll explicitly map code components to specific sections in the documentation, creating a clear traceability matrix.
	4	Documentation Verification Checklist: Before submitting any code changes, I'll create and review a checklist that verifies each implementation detail against the technical documentation.
	5	Explicit Documentation Citations: When explaining implementations, I'll cite specific sections of the documentation (e.g., "As per TDD.md Section 3.2.5...").
	6	Test-Documentation Alignment: Ensure test cases directly reflect the requirements and examples provided in the documentation.
	7	Regular Documentation Re-Review: Periodically re-read the documentation during implementation to catch any missed details.
	8	Comparative Analysis: Before finalizing implementation, perform a side-by-side comparison of the code against documentation requirements.
