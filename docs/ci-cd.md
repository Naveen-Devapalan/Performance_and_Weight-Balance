# CI/CD Documentation

## Overview
Our CI/CD pipeline automates testing, building, and code quality checks using GitHub Actions.

## Workflow Configuration
The workflow is defined in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](cci:7://file:///Users/bhargav/AI_stuff/My_projects/Performance_and_Weight-Balance/.github/workflows/ci.yml:0:0-0:0) and includes:
- Linting with ESLint
- Type checking with TypeScript
- Unit testing with Jest
- Code coverage reporting with Codecov

## Running Tests Locally


## Interpreting CI Results

## Code Coverage
- Coverage reports are available at [Codecov](https://codecov.io)
