# Performance Charts Calculator – Revised PRD

## 1. Overview
**Product Name:** Performance Charts Calculator  
**Description:** A web application that calculates critical aircraft performance metrics (weight & balance, takeoff distance, landing distance) using standard aviation data. The tool will store the performance tables (e.g., ground roll, distance at 50 ft AGL) in a lightweight database for quick reference.  
**Purpose:** Provide an accessible, no-login tool that allows pilots and other aviation professionals to retrieve accurate performance numbers based on a combination of aircraft parameters, pressure altitude, and temperature.

## 2. Purpose & Objectives
- **Purpose:**  
  - Allow users to quickly select or input flight conditions (altitude, temperature, etc.) and retrieve the appropriate performance data from stored tables.
  - Offer calculations for weight & balance, takeoff, and landing performance in a single, user-friendly interface.

- **Objectives:**  
  - Provide an intuitive data entry interface to specify flight conditions (pressure altitude, temperature).
  - Instantly display the relevant table values (e.g., ground roll, distance at 50 ft AGL) for those conditions.
  - Offer basic calculations for weight & balance using user-entered data (e.g., aircraft empty weight, payload, fuel).
  - Require no user authentication, ensuring quick and universal access.

## 3. Scope
- **Included:**
  - **Data Input:** Fields for altitude, temperature, aircraft weight, etc.  
  - **Performance Tables:** Storage of reference data from attached documents in a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, or a simple NoSQL).  
  - **Lookup & Display:** Based on user inputs, fetch the appropriate performance values (ground roll, 50 ft AGL distance) from the database.  
  - **Weight & Balance Calculator:** A simple module for computing center of gravity based on standard formula.  
  - **UI/UX:** Clean, minimal design that references the look of provided tables (further refined in future design stages).

- **Excluded:**  
  - Advanced user authentication or account management.  
  - Batch or file-based input beyond the basic input fields.  
  - Complex data analytics beyond retrieving or interpolating the stored chart data.

## 4. Target Audience
- **Primary Users:**  
  - Pilots, dispatchers, flight instructors needing quick performance lookups.  
  - Student pilots and flight schools wanting a reference tool during training.

- **Secondary Users:**  
  - Aviation enthusiasts seeking a simple way to understand aircraft performance constraints.

## 5. Functional Requirements
1. **Database of Performance Tables:**  
   - Store the provided performance data (pressure altitude, temperature, ground roll, distance at 50 ft AGL) in a lightweight, easily maintainable format (e.g., SQLite or a small relational database).  
   - Provide a simple admin script or interface to update these tables if needed (optional for future).

2. **Data Input & Lookup:**  
   - Users enter flight conditions (pressure altitude, temperature) in the UI.  
   - The application fetches matching rows or interpolates from the stored tables to display distance values (ground roll, at 50 ft AGL).

3. **Weight & Balance Computation:**  
   - Basic form for entering empty weight, fuel, and payload.  
   - Calculate center of gravity to ensure it remains within safe limits.  
   - Display a pass/fail or “within limits” message based on results.

4. **Output Display:**  
   - Show table lookups for takeoff and landing distances.  
   - Present weight & balance results in a concise, user-friendly manner.  
   - Optionally display approximate interpolation if the user’s altitude/temperature doesn’t exactly match stored values.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:**  
  - Quick lookups from the database for near-instantaneous retrieval.

- **Usability:**  
  - Simple, uncluttered UI requiring minimal user training.  
  - Responsive design for desktop and tablet.

- **Scalability:**  
  - Lightweight database can scale to more performance data or additional aircraft types in future updates.

- **Security:**  
  - HTTPS for secure data transmission.  
  - Minimal data stored (no PII), so only basic measures for database access control are needed.

---

## 7. Technical Requirements
- **Frontend:**  
  - A JavaScript framework (e.g., React/Vue) or plain HTML/JS for minimal overhead.  
  - Simple forms for user input and results display.

- **Backend:**  
  - Node.js/Express or Python/Flask (any lightweight server) to handle requests.  
  - Interpolate or do direct lookups from the database.

- **Database:**  
  - SQLite or a small relational DB (PostgreSQL/MySQL) to store performance tables.  
  - Ability to easily update or add new rows as performance data expands.

- **Deployment:**  
  - Host on a simple cloud environment (e.g., AWS EC2, Heroku, or Azure App Service).  
  - Basic CI/CD pipeline for smooth updates.

---

## 8. Assumptions & Dependencies
- The performance data from the attached documents is final and has no licensing restrictions for usage in this tool.  
- Additional performance tables or aircraft variants can be added later if needed.  
- The user’s environment (browser) supports modern JavaScript or minimal polyfills.
