# Test Strategy Document

## 1. Introduction
This **Test Strategy** outlines how our **Performance Charts Calculator** (for the Tecnam P2008JC aircraft) will be developed using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles. It also references best practices for writing and managing test cases, as described in the “Test Guide” document. We’ll define our overall approach to testing, including the roles, test flows, and the specific TDD process integrated into our software lifecycle.

### 1.1 Purpose
- Integrate TDD principles from the outset, ensuring that test cases guide feature implementation.
- Leverage the guidelines from “Test Guide” to write clear, structured test cases that streamline QA activities.
- Outline the overall testing approach, from unit to acceptance tests, ensuring coverage for W&B calculations, takeoff/landing performance, and any relevant edge cases.

### 1.2 Scope
- **In Scope**  
  - TDD-based development for new features and critical fixes.  
  - Automated tests for unit and integration levels, with manual test cases for end-to-end and acceptance testing.
- **Out of Scope**  
  - Performance and stress testing at scale (we will do basic checks but not advanced load tests).  
  - Security penetration testing or specialized compliance checks.

## 2. Test-Driven Development Approach

### 2.1 TDD Overview
Test-driven development (TDD) is a process where we write test cases **before** writing the production code. The cycle typically follows:
1. **Write a failing test** (no code for the feature yet).
2. **Run tests** and confirm the new test fails.
3. **Write minimal code** to pass the test.
4. **Run tests** again; if it passes, proceed.
5. **Refactor** the code for clarity, performance, etc.
6. **Repeat** for the next feature or scenario.

### 2.2 TDD Workflow in Our Project
1. **Requirements & Acceptance Criteria**  
   - The product owner or BA provides acceptance criteria for each user story (e.g., “The user can enter weight/fuel data and see CG calculation.”).
2. **Draft a Test Case**  
   - The QA engineer (using “Test Guide” best practices) creates or updates the relevant test case, focusing on a single scenario (e.g., user enters pilot=75 kg, baggage=3 kg, fuel=59.79 kg → CG must be ~1.9058).
3. **Implement the Test (Unit or Integration)**  
   - A developer writes a failing test in the codebase, referencing the test scenario steps.
4. **Write Minimal Production Code**  
   - Developer writes code for W&B logic or runway performance to pass the test.
5. **Run All Tests**  
   - If the new test passes, we proceed. If not, fix or refine the code.
6. **Refactor**  
   - Clean up code, ensuring we maintain a green test suite.

### 2.3 Benefits of TDD
- **Early bug detection**: Issues are caught when the cost to fix is minimal.
- **Living documentation**: Tests describe exactly how features should behave, effectively doubling as documentation.
- **Confidence in refactoring**: With a robust test suite, we can safely update code without breaking existing functionality.

## 3. Test Levels and Coverage

### 3.1 Unit Tests
- **Definition**: Low-level tests focusing on a single function or component in isolation.
- **Examples**:
  - `calculateCG()` function test with various weight inputs.
  - `applyWindCorrection()` function test for -5/+15 m (takeoff) or -4/+13 m (landing).

### 3.2 Integration Tests
- **Definition**: Validate interactions between modules, such as the W&B module and the database or the performance tables and the interpolation logic.
- **Examples**:
  - `POST /api/performance/takeoff` with a sample payload → check the JSON output for correct ground roll distance.

### 3.3 System Tests
- **Definition**: End-to-end checks from the frontend forms to the backend calculations, verifying the entire flow.
- **Examples**:
  - Fill out the “Weight & Balance” form in the UI, click “Calculate,” confirm the displayed CG matches the test scenario.

### 3.4 Acceptance Tests
- **Definition**: High-level tests verifying that the system meets user requirements and acceptance criteria.
- **Examples**:
  - Ensure that the user can input QNH, runway slope, temperature, etc., and the final distance is correct for a real pilot scenario.

## 4. Test Case Writing Guidelines

### 4.1 Reference to “Test Guide”
We’ll follow the “Test Guide” best practices:
- **Use clear, descriptive titles** for each test case.
- **Keep test steps concise** (no more than 10–15 steps).
- **Include preconditions** (e.g., user is logged in, user is on the “W&B” page).
- **Define expected results** in detail (e.g., “Takeoff Weight must be ~596.61 KG, CG ~1.9058, within forward limit 1.841 and aft limit 1.978.”).
- **Mark priority** (P1 for critical scenarios, P2 for important, P3 for optional).

### 4.2 TDD-Specific Format
Since TDD requires writing tests in code before the feature is implemented, the “test case” also becomes a test function. For instance:

describe("WeightAndBalance", () => {
  it("calculates correct CG for pilot=75, baggage=3, fuel=59.79", () => {
    // 1. Setup: pass input data
    // 2. Execution: call the function
    // 3. Verification: expect CG ~1.9058
  });
});
We’ll still keep high-level test case documentation in a test management tool or spreadsheet, linking each coded test function to a test case ID for traceability.

## 5. Tools and Infrastructure

### 5.1 Development Tools

- **Node.js/Express** (or Python/Flask) for the backend.
- **Mocha/Jest** (or Pytest) for TDD approach.

### 5.2 CI/CD Integration

- **GitHub Actions** (or similar) to run all tests on each commit.
- Automatic build fails if any test does not pass.

### 5.3 Test Management

- We can store high-level test cases (scenarios, acceptance tests) in a tool like Jira XRay or a simple spreadsheet.
- Link each test case ID to the TDD-coded test in the repository for easy cross-reference.

## 6. Roles & Responsibilities

|Role|Responsibilities|
|---|---|
|**Developers**|Write unit/integration tests in code before implementing features (TDD). Fix bugs.|
|**QA Engineer**|Draft higher-level test cases, coordinate acceptance tests, review code-based tests for coverage.|
|**Project Manager**|Ensure TDD adoption, coordinate sprints, track progress, manage backlog.|
|**Product Owner**|Provide acceptance criteria, verify final acceptance tests meet business needs.|

---

## 7. Execution Flow

1. **Pick a user story** from the backlog (e.g., “As a pilot, I want to see correct CG so that I can ensure safe flight.”).
2. **Write acceptance criteria** (e.g., CG must be within forward/aft limit).
3. **QA** creates or refines the test case in the management tool referencing the acceptance criteria.
4. **Dev** writes a **failing unit test** for the new feature (TDD approach).
5. **Dev** implements minimal code to pass the test.
6. **Dev** or QA writes or updates **integration/system test** for end-to-end coverage.
7. **All tests** run automatically in CI/CD pipeline.
8. If tests pass, we proceed; if not, fix or refine until green.

## 8. Test Data and Environments

### 8.1 Test Data

- **W&B** sample data: pilot=75 kg, baggage=3, fuel=59.79, etc.
- **Performance** sample data: QNH=1019, slope=0.12, wind=12 kts.
- Additional edge cases: negative fuel, extreme altitude, temperature beyond table range.

### 8.2 Test Environments

- **Dev Environment**: Local machine or small cloud instance with mock data.
- **Staging**: Hosted environment with near-production data.
- **Production**: Final environment, typically tested only for acceptance or smoke tests.

## 9. Reporting and Metrics

- **Daily test runs** in CI/CD with pass/fail counts.
- **Coverage metrics** for unit tests (lines/functions covered).
- **Defect tracking** in a ticketing system (e.g., Jira).
- **Acceptance test sign-off** by Product Owner once all TDD-coded tests pass for a story.
